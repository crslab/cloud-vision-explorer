## Deployment on Google Chrome browser

Google Chrome has a default behaviour of "swipe left to go back". 
This interferes with our dynamic slider when the user drags the handle, so we will disable it.  

### The fix

Open Chrome and paste this in the URL bar: `chrome://flags/#overscroll-history-navigation`
