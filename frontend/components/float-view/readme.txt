Many informative stuff in console.log for now.

To try this,

1. 3 options.
1a. Click Or ClickAndHoldDown some non picture. Nothing happens, go to Step 1.
1b. Click picture A. Previews the picture, but nothing much happens anyway, go to Step 1.
1c. ClickkAndHoldDown for 0.7s picture A. Selects the picture, go to Step 2.

2. (Similar to Step 1)
2a. Click Or ClickAndHoldDown some non picture. Nothing happens, go to Step 2.
2b. Click picture B. Previews the picture, but nothing much happens anyway, go to Step 2.
2c. ClickkAndHoldDown for 0.7s picture B. Selects the picture, a line joins picture A and B, now we are at interpolate mode and clicking/holddingdown on other pictures should do nothing. go to Step 3.

3. 3 options.
3a. Click or ClickAndHoldDown some place far away from the line. Nothing happens, note the console printouts though, go to Step 3.
3b. Click some place near the line. Nothing happens since (NOT IMPLEMENTED FOR NOW). Will run through decoder and preview the novel image, go to Step 3.
3c. ClickAndHoldDown some place near the line. Selects the interpolation, decodes it and make it the newest artwork to be joined with Step 4 and beyond.

4. Blablabla similar to Step 2. It should explain itself. Line will now join between novel artwork in Step 3 and Picture C.

Additional features: 
Pictures previously chosen can no longer be chosen again
There is a reset button at the top left of the screen.

Not so sure how to do a slider from x1,y1 to x2,y2.... for now.
