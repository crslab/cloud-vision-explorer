For now:

1) Open new Google Sheets document
2) Go to `Tools -> Script Editor`
3) Replace any code with the contents of `vision-spreadsheet.gs`
4) Reload your Sheets page
5) A new menu called `Cloud Vision Explorer` should be next to `Help`
6) Now, using the `Load Most Recent Cluster Data` to load in data
   from CVE, and `Generate Sample Charts` to display sample visualizations
